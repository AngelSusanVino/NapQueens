Superstore Data Analysis 
### Project Description

In this project, we performed a comprehensive analysis of our dataset, focusing on various aspects such as sales, profit, regional distribution, and category performance. Our key steps and findings are as follows:

**1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration**:
- Loaded the dataset and performed initial data exploration to understand its structure and content.
- Identified and handled missing values, particularly in the 'Postal Code' column.

**2. Descriptive Statistics**:
- Generated summary statistics for numerical columns to understand the distribution of values and detect outliers.
- Visualized the data distribution using histograms and boxplots.

**3. Outlier Detection and Analysis**:
- Identified outliers in sales, profit, and other key metrics, which helped highlight potential anomalies or data quality issues.

**4. Sales and Profit Analysis**:
- Created visualizations to understand sales and profit trends over time, revealing an overall upward trend with seasonal fluctuations.
- Highlighted the volatility in profitability, indicating potential challenges in cost management or pricing strategies.

**5. Regional Sales and Profit Distribution**:
- Analyzed sales and profit distribution across different states, identifying key states with high sales concentration.
- Created bar plots to visualize total sales and profit by state, as well as identifying states with the least sales and profit.

**6. Category and Sub-Category Analysis**:
- Examined sales and profit performance by category and sub-category.
- Created scatter plots to compare highly profitable and highest sales categories, and interactive plots to show the distribution of sales and profit across different segments.

**7. Customer Analysis**:
- Identified top customers based on sales and profit.
- Generated visualizations to highlight customers with the highest purchases and profitability.

**8. Shipping Analysis**:
- Investigated the relationship between order date and ship date based on categories.
- Created heatmaps to visualize shipping durations across different categories and time periods.

**Key Findings**:
- Sales are increasing over time, showing business growth, with some seasonal fluctuations.
- Profit shows more volatility than sales, indicating potential issues with cost control or pricing strategies.
- Sales are concentrated in a few key states, suggesting strong market potential but also opportunities for expansion.
- Technology and Office Supplies categories are driving overall sales and profits, while the Furniture category may need further analysis due to potential profitability issues.
